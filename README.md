# xMorse

This is the source code for [xMorse](http://xmorse.com), a web app for Morse code training and practice. The goal of this project is to make learning Morse code easier and more enjoyable.

xMorse uses the Web Audio API and thus requires a modern browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc. Unfortunately, no browser branded as Internet Explorer supports the Web Audio API.

Other than using TypeScript, LESS, and Webpack 2, this project is very "vanilla". No particular client-side web frameworks are used, so the deployed site is relatively slim and fast.
