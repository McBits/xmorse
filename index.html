				<p>
					It can be boring to transcribe random snippets of text from a Morse code training app.
					Once you can "read" or "copy" (i.e. transcribe) at a comfortable pace, chatting allows you to
					hone your skills by chatting with other users who are also learning along with you.
				</p>

				<p>
					This site does not fully simulate a Morse code key. Instead, the goal is to make it as easy
					as possible to pick up the code.
				</p>

				<p>
					To transmit your own messages, press the space bar or click/tap on the <strong>Beep</strong> button. It is also possible
					to transmit by clicking on characters in the "cheat sheet", but you should only use this feature
					sparingly. Remember, the point is to learn!
				</p>

				<h3>But why?</h3>

				<p>
					In emergency and survival scenarios, basic CW transmissions can be the simplest and most efficient
					means of radio communication. And Morse code can also be used in other types of communication.
					(Think: Smoke signals!)
				</p>

				<aside>
					Did you know: It's actually not uncommon for video games and movies to have "easter eggs"
					based on Morse code!
				</aside>

				<p>
					Although there is no longer a Morse code requirement for amateur radio licensing in the USA and
					many other countries, it's
					still a good idea to learn a minimum of 5 WPM. Even better to reach 15-20 WPM, which is pretty
					typical for CW communications worldwide. Morse code is a nice skill to have, even if you never
					operate a radio, although I hope spreading the knowledge of the code will inspire more people to
					get licensed and get on the air.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you have your license and a real radio, knowing Morse code will help you potentially reach
					millions of people around the world. Morse code can be sent and received over channels that are
					much too noisy for voice communications, and you won't need the sophisticated gear involved with
					encoding/decoding data transmissions.
				</p>

				<h3>Learning the code</h3>

				<p>
					How long does it take to learn Morse code? Many people pick up the basic letters, numbers, and
					common punctuation within just a few hours of practice. However, it can take several
					weeks or more to reach a speed that allows for comfortable communication. Generally, 15 words per
					minute is a good target to aim for. After that, you can gradually practice to build your speed up to
					20 or 30 WPM. (People who copy above 30 WPM are comparatively rare, but then it's always a treat to
					connect with someone who can keep up!)
				</p>

				<p>
					Just keep listing at a speed that's slightly too fast to keep up. Copy as much as you can, always keeping
					in mind that you won't capture everything, and that's okay. Once you start getting mentally fatigued
					(perhaps 15 to 45 minutes), reduce the speed a notch and practice for a few minutes
					at a more manageable speed.
				</p>

				<p>
					As soon as you have the characters committed to memory, start trying to recognize pairs, triplets,
					and even whole words. This is <em>essential</em> for reaching higher speeds. There is a point around
					15 to 20 WPM where it becomes impossible for your brain to decode Morse code character-by-character. Rather,
					you will find yourself keeping a small buffer of characters in your head, clearing that buffer in small
					batches at regular intervals. Challenge yourself!
				</p>

				<p>
					When you are <em>first beginning</em>, it can help to count the dits and dahs at very low speeds, form a mental
					image and then look up the letter in your mental lookup table. <strong>Try to break this habit as soon as possible</strong>.
